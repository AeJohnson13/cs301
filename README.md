# RPN Calc 

## Purpose
  RPN Calc implements a simple reverse polish notation calculator within a commmand line interface. It does this while also fullfilling the additional requirement of utilizing hand written x86 Assembly language. 
## Implementation 
  RPN Calc is implemented primarily in C++ with some additional x86 Assembly performing simple arithmetic operation. It operates in `white true` loop that will run until the user inputs an empty line, the specific logic is detailed in the below diagram.
